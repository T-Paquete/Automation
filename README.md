# Automation & Infrastructure as Code  
**Work-in-progress Automation Lab — Linux, Git, Vagrant, Bash Scripting, VIM**  

This repository is a personal lab to practice **Automation**, **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**, and **Linux system administration** skills.

The goal is to build a collection of practical examples, scripts, and notes to support the following focus areas:
- Linux Automation & System Admin
- Git Version Control
- Bash Scripting
- Infrastructure as Code with Vagrant
